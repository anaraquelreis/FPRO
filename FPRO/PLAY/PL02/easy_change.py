#You're helping a teller decide how to give change. 
#Write a Python script that given the price of the sale and the amount received by user input, 
#then prints a string indicating how many notes of each amount they have to give as change. 
#Consider that the largest note available is the 50â‚¬ note and that all prices and amounts received are multiples of 5 
#(no coins!).
#
#The result should be a string with the number of notes of each amount, separated by a space: "#50 #20 #10 #5".
#
#Hint: To help format the result, use type conversions to string.
